# SENSOR Token Reward System Integration

## Overview
The SENSOR token reward system has been successfully integrated into the ChainSensors device registration flow. When sellers register/claim devices, they automatically receive 50 SENSOR tokens as a reward with beautiful animations.

## What Was Integrated

### 1. Backend Integration (✅ Complete)
- **Reward Service**: Located in `backend/src/rewards/`
  - `reward.service.ts` - Handles token minting
  - `reward.rules.ts` - Defines reward amounts (50 tokens for device registration)
  - `reward.controller.ts` - API endpoints for rewards

- **Token Service**: `backend/src/solana/token.service.ts`
  - Mints SENSOR tokens to user wallets
  - Handles SPL token operations
  - Manages mint authority and token accounts

- **Device Registration Rewards**:
  - `dps.service.ts` - Added reward in `finalizeRegistration()` method (line 203)
  - `dps.service.ts` - Added reward in `assignSeller()` method for device claiming (lines 331-340)

### 2. Frontend Integration (✅ Complete)
- **SensorBalance Component**: Displays token balance with animations
- **RewardParticles Component**: Creates beautiful particle effects
- **Reward System**: 
  - `useSensorReward.ts` - Global reward event system
  - `emitReward()` function triggers animations

- **Device Registration Flows**:
  - `RegisterDeviceClient.tsx` - Updated claim flow to trigger reward animation
  - `DeviceRegistration.tsx` - New CSR-based registration with rewards
  - Both flows now call `emitReward(50)` on successful registration

### 3. Animation System (✅ Complete)
- **Navbar**: Shows SENSOR balance with animated updates
- **Particle Effects**: Sparkle/confetti animation on reward
- **Balance Animation**: Count-up animation and glow effects
- **Event Bus**: Global reward event system for cross-component communication

## How It Works

### Device Registration Flow (CSR-based):
1. User fills device info (name, type, location, etc.)
2. User confirms transaction → calls `dps/enroll` → `dps/finalize`
3. Backend calls `rewardService.rewardFor(sellerPubkey, 'deviceRegistration')`
4. Backend mints 50 SENSOR tokens to user's wallet
5. Frontend calls `emitReward(50)` to trigger animations
6. User sees particle effects and balance update

### Device Claiming Flow (Hardware-first):
1. User claims pre-configured device with device ID + code
2. Backend calls `assignSeller()` → `rewardService.rewardFor()`
3. Backend mints 50 SENSOR tokens to user's wallet
4. Frontend calls `emitReward(50)` to trigger animations
5. User sees reward notification and animations

## Environment Variables Required

### Backend (.env):
```bash
SOLANA_RPC=https://api.devnet.solana.com
SENSOR_MINT=qYPF5D94YCN3jfvsdM92Qfu2CukFFbbMmJyHgE6iZUV
MINT_AUTHORITY_KEYPAIR_JSON=[1,2,3...] # 64-element keypair array
```

### Frontend (.env.local):
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENSOR_MINT=qYPF5D94YCN3jfvsdM92Qfu2CukFFbbMmJyHgE6iZUV
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_RPC=https://api.devnet.solana.com
```

## User Experience

1. **Registration**: User sees reward info before confirming
2. **Transaction**: Backend automatically mints tokens after successful registration
3. **Animation**: Beautiful particle effects and balance count-up animation
4. **Notification**: Success message mentions the 50 SENSOR token reward
5. **Balance**: Navbar shows updated balance with glow effect

## Key Features

✅ **Automatic Rewards**: No additional user action required  
✅ **Beautiful Animations**: Particle effects and smooth transitions  
✅ **Error Handling**: Rewards don't block registration if they fail  
✅ **Multiple Flows**: Works for both CSR registration and device claiming  
✅ **Balance Tracking**: Real-time balance updates in navbar  
✅ **Privacy Controls**: Users can hide/show balance  
✅ **Mobile Friendly**: Haptic feedback on mobile devices  

## Files Modified/Created

### Backend:
- `src/dps/dps.service.ts` - Added reward calls
- `src/configuration.ts` - Added SENSOR_MINT config

### Frontend:
- `app/seller/devices/RegisterDeviceClient.tsx` - Added reward to claim flow
- `app/seller/devices/DeviceRegistration.tsx` - New CSR registration component
- `components/sensor/` - Complete reward animation system

The integration is clean, non-intrusive, and provides an excellent user experience with immediate visual feedback when users earn rewards!
